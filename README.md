## Description

With regard to LLMs, there are a few key limiting beliefs that have to be overcome to tap into their power. 

1) There is the understanding that it is an interface, but actually, it is an engine
2) There is the understanding that a problem can be fed to it, and that is sufficient, but actually, it is just a more evolved way to articulate solutions i.e., we still have to explain the solution to it
3) There is the understanding that the correct way to communicate with it is by giving natural language instructions, but actually, it highly prefers a kind of a novel markup language
4) There is the understanding that building and maintaining context is beneficial, when mostly the opposite is true

Points 2-4 are a major cause for the LLM to go "sideways" with more complex things. It seems that a major source of the sense of complexity for the LLM comes from the way we interact with it (based on these misunderstandings). 

This repository shares various policies, which are a solution to the above-mentioned problems. Policies are the intersection between human language and LLM language.

<!-- This section provides a high-level overview for the repo -->

## Integrations

## Docs

1) Get the policy you want from here: https://github.com/Vaquum/llm-protocols/tree/main/protocols by clicking the file, and then clicking raw and copying that
2) Create new Project in Claude, and name it based on the policy
3) Add the policy to the instructions for that project
4) Whenever you want to use that policy, click Projects in Claude, and start a new chat there by asking it to run the policy on whatever topic you want

After the final step, you end up with something like:
